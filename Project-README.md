# The School of Code Tech Library

## Our Brief
"To improve the lives of bootcampers on the course"

## Our Solution
We wanted to create a resource library for useful tech links. We wanted it to be user lead and easy to update.

## Project details
A React front end interacts with an Express backend that provides link to a Postgres database within Heroku.
Built in just three days by a fully remote team, we managed our workflow using Notion.io and implemented Agile methodology using a framework with  daily stand upâ€™s and retros.
## Tech stack
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Express.js, Node.js, Material UI, Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest, Cypress, Figma.

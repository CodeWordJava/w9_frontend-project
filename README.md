# Student Resource Library

## Our Brief
"To improve the lives of bootcampers on the course."

## Our Solution
We wanted to create a resource library for useful tech links. We wanted it to be user lead and easy to update.

## Project details
A React front end interacts with an Express backend that provides links to a Postgres database within Heroku.
Built in just three days by a fully remote team, we managed our workflow using Notion.io and implemented Agile methodology using a framework with daily stand ups and retros.
